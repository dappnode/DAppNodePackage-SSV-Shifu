# SSV Göerli Testnet V2 "Shifu"

If you entered your SK (Secret Key) during the install of this package, you've created your V2 "Shifu" SSV.Network Operator!

For it to function properly, you'll have to register it with the SSV network.

## _**IMPORTANT**_

_This package requires a synced Ethereum Göerli/Prater Testnet Client Stack, as configured in the StakersUI in order to function.  Without this it will not function.  It has been tested with all clients currently availble in the store._

### Operator Registration

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate other validators, and is done by broadcasting a transaction to the SSV network smart contract (in Goerli) with your operator's display name and public key that was generated as part of your node setup.

Register your new operator (**DO NOT REUSE OPERATORS FROM THE V1 TESTNET**) using this [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register)

After registration, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and SSV stakers can choose you as one of their validators operators.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/registration) to register your operator.

Full official documentation can be found [here](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/introduction).
