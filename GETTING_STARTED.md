# SSV GÃ¶erli Testnet V2 "Shifu"

If you entered your SK (Secret Key) during the install of this package, you've created your V2 "Shifu" SSV.Network operator!

For it to function properly, you'll have to register it in the network.

## Operator Registration

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate other validators, and is done by broadcasting a transaction to the SSV network smart contract (in Goerli) with your operator's display name and public key that was generated as part of your node setup.

Register your new operator (**DO NOT REUSE OPERATORS FROM THE V1 TESTNET**) using this [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register)

After signing up, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and other users can choose you as one of their validators operator.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/registration) to register your operator. 

Official documentation can be found [here](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/introduction).
