If you have introduced your SK (Secret Key) during the install of this package, you've created your SSV.Network operator!

For it to function, you'll have to register it in the network.

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate other validators, and is done by broadcasting a transaction to the SSV network smart contract (in Goerli) with your operators display name and public key that was generated as part of your node setup.

After signing up, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and other users can choose you as one of their validators operator.

Follow [these](https://docs.ssv.network/operators/installation-operator-1/registering-new-operator-on-the-ssv-network/register-via-interface) instructions to register your operator.
