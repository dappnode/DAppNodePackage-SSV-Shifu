# SSV Göerli Testnet "Shifu" V2

If you entered your SK (Secret Key) during the install of this package, you've created your V2 "Shifu" SSV.Network Operator!

For it to function properly, you'll have to register it with the SSV network.

## _**IMPORTANT**_

_This package requires a synced Ethereum Göerli/Prater Testnet Client Stack, as configured in the [Prater StakersUI](http://my.dappnode/#/stakers/prater) in order to function properly._

### Operator Registration

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate other validators, and is done by broadcasting a transaction to the SSV network smart contract (on the Goerli/Prater testnet) with your Operator's display name and public key that was generated as part of your node setup.

**Operators from the "Shifu" V1 Testnet** can continue using their same operator/keys in this  V2, but please note that during the upgrade period the SSV Web App and Web Explorer will be be down for upgrades.

Register your new operator (_Do not reuse operators from the V1 "Primus" testnet_) using this [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register)

After registration, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and SSV stakers can choose you as one of their validator's operators.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/registration) to register your operator.

Full official documentation can be found [here](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/introduction).
